*lns* is a scripting language written in C++.

Visit the Wiki section for information about the language, the command and the interpreter.

Anyone can contribute to *lns*. You are welcome to clone or fork the repository, modify it and make a pull request to improve the interpreter. You can even implement new features: you may find some ideas on what to implement in the Issues section.  

## Installation ##

*lns* is currently available only for Linux.
To install, extract the contents of the repository and execute the script `scripts/install_local.sh`. The program will be installed in a folder named `/lns` in the root directory and a link to the executable will be created in the `/usr/bin/` folder (it will require the user to input the password for administrator privileges).
