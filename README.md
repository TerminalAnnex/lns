Visit the Wiki section for information about the language, the command and the interpreter.
## Credits ##

The idea of the *lns* interpreter started off as a personal project inspired to [Bob Nystrom's "Crafting Interpreters"](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/ "Crafting Interpreters website") online book, which shows a very basic way to implement an interpreter in Java.  
At this time the two project differ in most of their parts (including the syntax definitions, the language structure and the implementation language itself), but you can see some common aspects in their structure.  
The two projects don't have any file in common.
